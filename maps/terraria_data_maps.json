    "description": "Let's combine two popular games and have some Counter Strike-style fun with Terraria's game mechanics? The task of the map is simple, but not without peculiarities. The terrorists must get to the dungeon, kill the Skeletron and find the Mechanic in the Dungeon, buy wires and a wrench, and then try to connect a lever near the tower to explosives and, accordingly, blow up this tower.It's simple, right? The Counter-Terrarists have a simpler task, but no less important - while the Terrarists make their little journey for copper cable to hand it over to a collection point for non-ferrous metals by the wires to the Mechanic in Dungeon, the Counter-Terrarians must prepare to meet the “guests”. How the preparations will take place - it all depends on your imagination and the time that you will have from the beginning of the game to the moment of meeting.\n\nThe card is designed for the number of players from two to eight people. Best of all, of course, eight, since there are 4 classes in the game and the most interesting game will turn out just with the full complement.\n\nPlayer Classes:\n\tDemoman\n\tattack plane\n\tSniper\n\tHeavy infantry",
