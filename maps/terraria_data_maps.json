They are only accessible through game modification software like inventory editors and tools like Terraria Tweaker, the latter which prevents automatic in-game removal of unobtainable items. Features may also be labeled as unobtainable due to being only partially obtainable\nUnimplemented refers to features that are only partially present in the game files. Due to incomplete coding, being replaced by another feature (such as another item), or forced deletion, they cannot be accessed in-game, even with software like inventory editors. The only exception to this inaccessibility is the Boring Bow, which can be placed in the inventory.\nRemoved refers to features that have been completely removed from the game for various reasons, ranging from copyright liability to former-exclusivity. There is no longer any data related to them present in the game's files, and their Data IDs are typically replaced by something else.",

    "description": "Let's combine two popular games and have some Counter Strike-style fun with Terraria's game mechanics? The task of the map is simple, but not without peculiarities. The terrorists must get to the dungeon, kill the Skeletron and find the Mechanic in the Dungeon, buy wires and a wrench, and then try to connect a lever near the tower to explosives and, accordingly, blow up this tower.It's simple, right? The Counter-Terrarists have a simpler task, but no less important - while the Terrarists make their little journey for copper cable to hand it over to a collection point for non-ferrous metals by the wires to the Mechanic in Dungeon, the Counter-Terrarians must prepare to meet the “guests”. How the preparations will take place - it all depends on your imagination and the time that you will have from the beginning of the game to the moment of meeting.\n\nThe card is designed for the number of players from two to eight people. Best of all, of course, eight, since there are 4 classes in the game and the most interesting game will turn out just with the full complement.\n\nPlayer Classes:\n\tDemoman\n\tattack plane\n\tSniper\n\tHeavy infantry",
